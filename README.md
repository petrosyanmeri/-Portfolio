## Adele Song Analysis Project

In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of Adele’s discography to uncover trends and insights within her music catalog. The project involved several key steps:

Data Acquisition: I began by setting up Spotify for Developers to access the necessary data. I then wrote custom code to fetch detailed information about Adele’s songs, including attributes like popularity, album, and release dates.

Database Integration: The next step involved connecting an SQL database to my Python environment. This setup allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of data, ensuring a smooth workflow for analysis.

Data Analysis: Using Python, I conducted in-depth analysis to explore various aspects of the dataset. This included examining song popularity trends, thematic elements within titles, and album-specific patterns.

Visualization: To effectively communicate my findings, I created a dynamic Power BI dashboard. The dashboard features a range of visualizations, including bar charts, treemaps, and pie charts providing a clear and interactive view of the analysis results.

Tools Used:

Spotify for Developers (for data access)
Python (for data fetching and analysis)
SQL Database (for data management)
Power BI (for visualization)
This project not only highlights the analytical capabilities but also demonstrates the integration of various tools to create a cohesive and informative dashboard that offers valuable insights into Adele's music.
